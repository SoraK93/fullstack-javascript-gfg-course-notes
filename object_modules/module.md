# Modules in JavaScript
A file containing code that can be reused in other files.

# Why?
- Organised Code: Split large programs into smaller files.
- Reusability: Write a function once and reuse it anywhere.
- Maintainability: Easier to debug and update becase each module focuses on a specific functionality.
- Collaboration Made Easy: Enable multiple develipers to work on different files without interfering with each other. this significantly increases collaboration.

> [!NOTE]  
> In modern development as the codebase and its complexity grows larger and larger. Modules helps keep it clean and efficient. Its not covenience but a necessity too.

# JavaScript Modules
It allows us to split our code into smaller, manageable parts, which can be reused acress different files. This approach makes code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.

> Modules are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

# Using Import and Export
It helps in JavaScript and ReactJS, allowing developers to load modules from one file to another.

# Types
- **Default Export** (Refer Method-1 in code file)
- **Named Export** (Refer Method-2 in code file)
- **Dynamic Imports** (Refer Method-3 in code file)

### Dunamic Imports
- Allows to load specific modules when required
- Decrease initial load time
- Beneficial in large applications where centain modules is required to be loaded on certain pages.
