# Modules in JavaScript
A file containing code that can be reused in other files.

# Why?
- Organised Code: Split large programs into smaller files.
- Reusability: Write a function once and reuse it anywhere.
- Maintainability: Easier to debug and update becase each module focuses on a specific functionality.
- Collaboration Made Easy: Enable multiple develipers to work on different files without interfering with each other. this significantly increases collaboration.

> [!NOTE]  
> In modern development as the codebase and its complexity grows larger and larger. Modules helps keep it clean and efficient. Its not covenience but a necessity too.
